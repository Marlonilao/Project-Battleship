# Project-Battleship

**Battleship** is a simple JavaScript game built using **Test Driven Development (TDD)** principles. The project focuses on creating core game logic — including **Ship**, **Gameboard**, and **Player** factories — all tested with **Jest** before connecting to the user interface. Players take turns attacking coordinates on each other’s boards until one player’s fleet is completely sunk. This project demonstrates object-oriented design, modular architecture, and the separation of logic from DOM manipulation.
